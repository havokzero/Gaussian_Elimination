# ⚡️ Gaussian Elimination Solver - Fortran Edition ⚡️

Welcome to the **Gaussian Elimination Solver**! This Fortran program isn't just about solving systems of linear equations—it's about solving them with **flair**! We've taken the classic Gaussian elimination method and dressed it up with **colorful terminal output**, so you can enjoy a stylish experience while watching your matrices transform. 🎨

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This program leverages **Gaussian elimination** and **back substitution** to solve systems of linear equations. It takes a coefficient matrix **A** and a right-hand side vector **b**, processes them through elimination, and provides the solution vector **x**.

But why stop there? With this program, your output won't just be numbers—**it'll be art**! Watch as your matrix and vector are displayed with **vivid colors** that make math come to life. 🌈

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Gaussian Elimination** and **Back Substitution**: Efficiently solves systems of equations.
- **Color-coded Output**: Enjoy vibrant colors that highlight each step of the solution process.
- **Written in Fortran**: Tap into the power of one of the most legendary programming languages.
- Supports systems with up to **10 equations**.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this program, you'll need:
- A **Fortran compiler** (e.g., `gfortran`, `ifort`)
- A terminal that supports **ANSI escape codes** for color output.

---

## ⚙️ Running the Program

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fortran-gaussian-elimination.git
   cd fortran-gaussian-elimination
   ```

# Compile the Program
```bash
gfortran gaussian_elimination.f90 -o gaussian_elimination
```
# Run the Program
```bash
./gaussian_elimination
```

##🖥️ Example Output
-When you run the program, you'll be greeted with colorful output that transforms the way you see Gaussian elimination. Here's an example of what you'll see:
```bash
Coefficient matrix (A):
  2.0   -1.0    1.0
  3.0    3.0    9.0
  3.0    3.0    5.0

Right-hand side vector (b):
  8.0
  0.0
  2.0

Solution vector:
x( 1 ) =  2.0
x( 2 ) = -3.0
x( 3 ) =  1.0
```
-But don't just take our word for it—the colors bring it to life! Red, blue, cyan, and green will make your terminal pop, giving you a unique view into the world of linear algebra.

## 📚 How It Works
-Input: A coefficient matrix A and a right-hand side vector b.
-Gaussian Elimination: Eliminate coefficients below the main diagonal.
-Back Substitution: Solve for unknowns using the upper triangular matrix.
-Output: The solution vector x, color-coded for your viewing pleasure.

## 💡 Why Fortran?
-Why not? Fortran is a powerhouse for numerical computation, and this project brings out the best of its performance, combined with a splash of modern aesthetics. 
-It's a salute to the old-school programming giants while injecting some visual appeal into the terminal.
